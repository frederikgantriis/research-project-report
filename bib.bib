  abstract = {The amount of data extracted from production processes has increased exponentially due to the proliferation of sensing technologies. When processed and analyzed, data can bring out valuable information and knowledge from manufacturing process, production system and equipment. In industries, equipment maintenance is an important key, and affects the operation time of equipment and its efficiency. Thus, equipment faults need to be identified and solved, avoiding shutdown in the production processes. Machine Learning (ML) methods have been emerged as a promising tool in Predictive Maintenance (PdM) applications to prevent failures in equipment that make up the production lines in the factory floor. However, the performance of PdM applications depends on the appropriate choice of the ML method. The aim of this paper is to present a systematic literature review of ML methods applied to PdM, showing which are being explored in this field and the performance of the current state-of-the-art ML techniques. This review focuses on two scientific databases and provides a useful foundation on the ML techniques, their main results, challenges and opportunities, as well as it supports new research works in the PdM field.},

  abstract = {In this paper a multiple classifier machine learning methodology for Predictive Maintenance (PdM) is presented. PdM is a prominent strategy for dealing with maintenance issues given the increasing need to minimize downtime and associated costs. One of the challenges with PdM is generating so called 'health factors' or quantitative indicators of the status of a system associated with a given maintenance issue, and determining their relationship to operating costs and failure risk. The proposed PdM methodology allows dynamical decision rules to be adopted for maintenance management and can be used with high-dimensional and censored data problems. This is achieved by training multiple classification modules with different prediction horizons to provide different performance trade-offs in terms of frequency of unexpected breaks and unexploited lifetime and then employing this information in an operating cost based maintenance decision system to minimise expected costs. The effectiveness of the methodology is demonstrated using a simulated example and a benchmark semiconductor manufacturing maintenance problem.},

Prediction models are derived from logged on-board data that are downloaded during workshop visits and have been collected over three years on a large number of vehicles. A number of issues are identified with the data sources, many of which originate from the fact that the data sources were not designed for data mining. Nevertheless, exploiting this available data is very important for the automotive industry as means to quickly introduce predictive maintenance solutions. It is shown on a large data set from heavy duty trucks in normal operation how this can be done and generate a profit.},

  abstract = {Gearbox is an essential device employed in industries to vary speed and load conditions according to the requirements. More advancement in its design and operation leads to increase in industrial applications. The failure in any of the components of gearbox can lead to production loss and increase maintenance cost. The component failure has to be detected earlier to avoid unexpected breakdown. Vibration measurements are used to monitor the condition of the machine for predictive maintenance and to predict the gearbox faults successfully. This paper addresses the use of vibration signal for automated fault diagnosis of gearbox. In the experimental studies, good gears and face wear gears are used to collect vibration signals for good and faulty conditions of the gearbox. Each gear is tested with two different speeds and loading conditions. The statistical features are extracted from the acquired vibration signals. The extracted features are given as an input to the support vector machine (SVM) for fault identification. The Performance of the fault identification system using vibration signals are discussed and compared.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Setting and strength development of ordinary Portland cement (OPC) binders involves multiple interacting chemical reactions, resulting in the formation of a solid microstructure. A long-standing yet elusive goal has been to establish a basis for the prediction of the properties and performance of concrete using knowledge of the chemical and physical attributes of its components---PC, sand, stone, water, and chemical admixtures---together with the environmental conditions under which they react. Machine learning (ML) provides a               data-driven               basis for the estimation of properties, and has recently been applied to estimate the 28~days (compressive) strength of concrete from knowledge of its mixture proportions (Young et al,               Cem Concr Res               , 2019,               115               :379). Building on this success, the current work uses a diverse dataset of ASTM C150 cements, the chemical composition and other attributes of which have been measured. ML estimators were trained with this dataset to estimate both paste setting time and mortar strength development. The ML estimation errors are typically similar to the measurement repeatability of the relevant ASTM test methods, and are thus able to account for the influence of binder composition and fineness. This creates new opportunities to apply data intensive methods to optimize concrete formulations under multiple constraints of cost, CO               2               impact, and performance attributes.},

  abstract = {The application of artificial neural networks in mapping the mechanical characteristics of the cement-based materials is underlined in previous investigations. However, this machine learning technique includes several major deficiencies highlighted in the literature, such as the overfitting problem and the inability to explain the decisions. Hence, the present study investigates the applicability of other common machine learning techniques, i.e., support vector machine, random forest (RF), decision tree, AdaBoost and k-nearest neighbors in mapping the behavior of the compressive strength (CS) of cement-based mortars. To this end, a big experimental database has been compiled based on experimental data available in the literature considering, namely the cement grade, which is an important parameter for the modeling of mortar's CS. Other important parameters are namely the age, the water-to-binder ratio, the particle size distribution of the sand and the amount of plasticizer. Many models based on the influential factors affecting machine learning techniques have been developed, and their prediction capacities have been assessed using performance indexes. The present research highlights the potential of AdaBoost and RF models as useful tools which can assist in mortar design and/or optimization. In addition, mapping the development of mortar characteristics can assist in revealing the influence of the different mortar mix parameters on the compressive strength.},

  abstract = {Abstract Cement manufacturing is energy-intensive (5Gj/t) and comprises a significant portion of the energy footprint of concrete systems. Incorporating modern monitoring, simulation and control systems will allow lower energy use, lower environmental impact, and lower costs of this widely used construction material. One of the goals of the CESMII roadmap project on the Smart Manufacturing of Cement included developing an analytical process model for clinker quality that includes the chemistry of the kiln feed and accounts for critical process variables. This predictive model will be used in nonlinear model predictive control system designed to significantly reduce process energy use while maintaining or improving product quality. In the cement manufacturing plant used in this study, the kiln feed (meal) is tested every 12\,h and used to estimate the mineral composition of the cement kiln output (clinker) using the stoichiometry-based Bogue's model and the expertise of the plant operators. During kiln operation, kiln output (clinker) is sampled and tested every 2 h to measure its chemical and mineral composition. The predicted and measured values of the clinker composition are used by the plant operators to adjust the kiln input stream and the production process characteristics to maintain stable operation and uniform product quality. However, the time delay between prediction and testing, along with inaccuracies inherent in the Bogue's model have made any process changes designed to minimize energy use problematic, especially in-light of potential clinker quality issues that process changes often pose. A new analytical model that integrates quality information and process operation information has been developed from data collected from 2\,years of production from an operating cement facility. To make the model fuel-type-independent, consumed heat energy was computed in the model instead of fuel type and amount. A Feedforward Network was trained and tailored from collected data. Many data-based simulations were conducted to quantitatively evaluate the proposed model and the 5-fold cross-validation procedure was used to test the models. The resulting predictive model was shown to have a low root mean square error (MSE) with respect to the estimated clinker mineral composition compared to that using the industry standard ``Bogue' model''. The end goal of this work was to develop a single machine learning tool that allows the use of quality control data and process control variables to improve energy efficiency of the process in a continuous fashion. The proposed nonlinear model predictive control system (NMPC) can generate predicted kiln production characteristics based on manipulated variables in manner that accurately follows the target product quality values. Simulation results also show that the proposed model produced accurate predictions of kiln outputs that fell within the required constraints, while manipulating control variables within typical operational ranges.},

The preheating tower with its series of installed cyclones is essential in the cement kiln production process and it is considered among the most dangerous places in a cement plant. Coatings and blockages can often occur in the cyclone preheaters of rotary kiln plants for burning cement clinker. These wall build-ups disturb and/or block the process downward flow of hot kiln feed and the upward flow of hot kiln exhaust gases. Actually, our research aims to use process prediction by operating the digital transformation through a 4.0 tool for monitoring and analyzing temperature and pressure in real time. This tool monitors temperature and pressure using sensors that transform the data into a computer platform for real-time analysis and predicts failures according to a predictive model to prevent the occurrence of preheater cyclone blockages. This new technology will help to further improve occupational safety, increases the efficiency of industrial processes, and increases productivity.},

This examination delves into how AI powered automation processes can boost the effectiveness of carbon capture systems and improve maintenance practices, in oil and gas installations. Combining intelligence (AI) with procedures and systems in place to predict outcomes accurately can enhance the dependability and effectiveness of CCS technologies by tackling essential issues like constant monitoring in real-time and identifying faults for system optimization purposes efficiently. AI-powered automation processes implemented by facilities have the potential to boost the rates of CO2 sequestration while minimizing interruptions, resulting in a more effective carbon capture infrastructure. The methodology involves a systematic review of existing literature, peer-reviewed articles, case studies, and industry reports on AI techniques, such as machine learning and neural networks, in CCS. Databases like Google Scholar and IEEE Xplore were used, focusing on keywords like “AI in CCS” and “predictive maintenance. The analysis also explores real-life examples from oil and gas firms that have effectively integrated AI solutions into their carbon capture and storage endeavors, hence shedding light on strategies, hurdles, and upcoming developments in the field. The evaluation highlights how AI-driven automation processes significantly improve the efficiency and environmental sustainability of oil and gas facilities.},
