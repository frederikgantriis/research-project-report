\subsubsection{Hyper-parameter tuning}

For tuning the various model hyperparameters, grid search was deployed to systematically find the best variation of each model. To get an overview of which parameters were tuned for each model, \autoref{tab:hyperparameters} located in the appendix is provided.

The choice of which parameters to tune was based on the availability from the library used. Furthermore, the ranges of each parameter were chosen based on trial-and-error.
