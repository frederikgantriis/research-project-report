The following text is used as notes and should not be review:

XGB shows extraordinary good performance, even during stoppages.

Random forest shows weird patterns, where is reaches plateus, and does not fit the rapid changes that other models does.

Linear, Lasso, ElasticNet and Ridge all show good performance, but all seems to have some kind of bias since the curve is consistently placed lower than the ground truth.
