\section{Results}

All models explained in \autoref{sec:training}, apart from \xgbr and \xrf, were implemented using the \texttt{scikit-learn}\footnote{\url{https://scikit-learn.org/stable/}} library in the Python programming language. Both \xgbr and \xrf were implemented using the \textit{XGBoost}\footnote{\url{https://xgboost-clone.readthedocs.io/en/latest/}} library. Furthermore, all metrics used were also calculated using the mentioned \textit{scikit-learn} library.
