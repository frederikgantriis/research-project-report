\subsection{Data Analysis}

This project uses data given by \ap. All data is collected from the preheater tower mentioned in \autoref{sec:introduction}. This includes the following datapoints:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{PV1\_A\_Feed\_to\_Oven\_tons\_per\_day}:
    \item \texttt{PV2\_A\_Bottom\_Pressure}:
    \item \texttt{PV3\_A\_Bottom\_Temperature}:
    \item \texttt{PV4\_A\_Top\_Pressure}:
    \item \texttt{PV5\_A\_First\_Step\_Bottom\_Temperature}:
    \item \texttt{PV6\_A\_Second\_Step\_Bottom\_Temperature}:
    \item \texttt{PV7\_A\_Second\_Step\_Top\_Temperature}:
    \item \texttt{PV8\_A\_FlueGasFan\_Power}:
    \item \texttt{PV9\_A\_FlueGasFan\_Current}:
    \item \texttt{month}:
    \item \texttt{day}:
\end{itemize}

All of these values were then implemented twice: Once for the A side and once for the B side of the pre-heater tower.

In addition, two features were compute from the previous mentioned features:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{pressure\_diff}:
    \item \texttt{temperature\_diff}:
\end{itemize}

These two features were added, based on expert knowledge from \ap.

\subsubsection{Descriptive Statistics}

Before pre-processing and feature engineering, an explorative data analysis is needed to get a sense of which features would be deemed useful for the model, and how these features should be processed.

    \label{fig:descriptive_stats}
\end{figure}

\autoref{fig:descriptive_stats} gives a quick overview of the mean values of each feature. This illustration shows that, while temperature readings are quite high, all other features generally deviate in a smaller range. However, due to the high temperature readings, scaling the input would be critical to enable good results from the models.

\subsubsection{Correlation Analysis}
