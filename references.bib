Dispersion of robotic swarms appears to be applicable and useful in missions such as planetary exploration, hurricane surveillance, or nuclear decontamination, where the robots with maximal coverage collect samples from the unknown surface, detect the victims, or collect nuclear waste, respectively. In this paper, a simple dispersion algorithm based on wireless signal intensities is proposed and tested in a physics based simulator of a robotic platform which is particularly designed to serve as a test-bed for swarm-robotic studies. The signal intensities are realistically modeled using sampling technique, taking both the distance and relative orientations of the wireless sensors into account. The only parameter of the algorithm, a threshold parameter, is optimized in order to maximize the sensor coverage and minimize the number of disconnected robots.},

	abstract = {Abstract Cement manufacturing is energy-intensive (5Gj/t) and comprises a significant portion of the energy footprint of concrete systems. Incorporating modern monitoring, simulation and control systems will allow lower energy use, lower environmental impact, and lower costs of this widely used construction material. One of the goals of the CESMII roadmap project on the Smart Manufacturing of Cement included developing an analytical process model for clinker quality that includes the chemistry of the kiln feed and accounts for critical process variables. This predictive model will be used in nonlinear model predictive control system designed to significantly reduce process energy use while maintaining or improving product quality. In the cement manufacturing plant used in this study, the kiln feed (meal) is tested every 12 h and used to estimate the mineral composition of the cement kiln output (clinker) using the stoichiometry-based Bogue's model and the expertise of the plant operators. During kiln operation, kiln output (clinker) is sampled and tested every 2 h to measure its chemical and mineral composition. The predicted and measured values of the clinker composition are used by the plant operators to adjust the kiln input stream and the production process characteristics to maintain stable operation and uniform product quality. However, the time delay between prediction and testing, along with inaccuracies inherent in the Bogue's model have made any process changes designed to minimize energy use problematic, especially in-light of potential clinker quality issues that process changes often pose. A new analytical model that integrates quality information and process operation information has been developed from data collected from 2 years of production from an operating cement facility. To make the model fuel-type-independent, consumed heat energy was computed in the model instead of fuel type and amount. A Feedforward Network was trained and tailored from collected data. Many data-based simulations were conducted to quantitatively evaluate the proposed model and the 5-fold cross-validation procedure was used to test the models. The resulting predictive model was shown to have a low root mean square error (MSE) with respect to the estimated clinker mineral composition compared to that using the industry standard “Bogue’ model”. The end goal of this work was to develop a single machine learning tool that allows the use of quality control data and process control variables to improve energy efficiency of the process in a continuous fashion. The proposed nonlinear model predictive control system (NMPC) can generate predicted kiln production characteristics based on manipulated variables in manner that accurately follows the target product quality values. Simulation results also show that the proposed model produced accurate predictions of kiln outputs that fell within the required constraints, while manipulating control variables within typical operational ranges.},

Vibration measurements are used to monitor the condition of the machine for predictive maintenance and to predict the gearbox faults successfully. This paper addresses the use of vibration signal for automated fault diagnosis of gearbox. In the experimental studies, good gears and face wear gears are used to collect vibration signals for good and faulty conditions of the gearbox. Each gear is tested with two different speeds and loading conditions. The statistical features are extracted from the acquired vibration signals. The extracted features are given as an input to the support vector machine (SVM) for fault identification. The Performance of the fault identification system using vibration signals are discussed and compared.},

Coatings and blockages can often occur in the cyclone preheaters of rotary kiln plants for burning cement clinker. These wall build-ups disturb and/or block the process downward flow of hot kiln feed and the upward flow of hot kiln exhaust gases. Actually, our research aims to use process prediction by operating the digital transformation through a 4.0 tool for monitoring and analyzing temperature and pressure in real time. This tool monitors temperature and pressure using sensors that transform the data into a computer platform for real-time analysis and predicts failures according to a predictive model to prevent the occurrence of preheater cyclone blockages.

However, this machine learning technique includes several major deficiencies highlighted in the literature, such as the overfitting problem and the inability to explain the decisions. Hence, the present study investigates the applicability of other common machine learning techniques, i.e., support vector machine, random forest (RF), decision tree, AdaBoost and k-nearest neighbors in mapping the behavior of the compressive strength (CS) of cement-based mortars. To this end, a big experimental database has been compiled based on experimental data available in the literature considering, namely the cement grade, which is an important parameter for the modeling of mortar’s CS. Other important parameters are namely the age, the water-to-binder ratio, the particle size distribution of the sand and the amount of plasticizer. Many models based on the influential factors affecting machine learning techniques have been developed, and their prediction capacities have been assessed using performance indexes. The present research highlights the potential of AdaBoost and RF models as useful tools which can assist in mortar design and/or optimization. In addition, mapping the development of mortar characteristics can assist in revealing the influence of the different mortar mix parameters on the compressive strength.},

This examination delves into how AI powered automation processes can boost the effectiveness of carbon capture systems and improve maintenance practices, in oil and gas installations. Combining intelligence (AI) with procedures and systems in place to predict outcomes accurately can enhance the dependability and effectiveness of CCS technologies by tackling essential issues like constant monitoring in real-time and identifying faults for system optimization purposes efficiently. AI-powered automation processes implemented by facilities have the potential to boost the rates of CO2 sequestration while minimizing interruptions, resulting in a more effective carbon capture infrastructure.

PdM is a prominent strategy for dealing with maintenance issues given the increasing need to minimize downtime and associated costs. One of the challenges with PdM is generating so called ’health factors’ or quantitative indicators of the status of a system associated with a given maintenance issue, and determining their relationship to operating costs and failure risk. The proposed PdM methodology allows dynamical decision rules to be adopted for maintenance management and can be used with high-dimensional and censored data problems. This is achieved by training multiple classiﬁcation modules with different prediction horizons to provide different performance trade-offs in terms of frequency of unexpected breaks and unexploited lifetime and then employing this information in an operating cost based maintenance decision system to minimise expected costs. The effectiveness of the methodology is demonstrated using a simulated example and a benchmark semiconductor manufacturing maintenance problem.},

              Setting and strength development of ordinary Portland cement (OPC) binders involves multiple interacting chemical reactions, resulting in the formation of a solid microstructure. A long‐standing yet elusive goal has been to establish a basis for the prediction of the properties and performance of concrete using knowledge of the chemical and physical attributes of its components—PC, sand, stone, water, and chemical admixtures—together with the environmental conditions under which they react. Machine learning (ML) provides a
              data‐driven
              basis for the estimation of properties, and has recently been applied to estimate the 28 days (compressive) strength of concrete from knowledge of its mixture proportions (Young et al,

              , 2019,
              115
              :379). Building on this success, the current work uses a diverse dataset of ASTM C150 cements, the chemical composition and other attributes of which have been measured. ML estimators were trained with this dataset to estimate both paste setting time and mortar strength development. The ML estimation errors are typically similar to the measurement repeatability of the relevant ASTM test methods, and are thus able to account for the influence of binder composition and fineness. This creates new opportunities to apply data intensive methods to optimize concrete formulations under multiple constraints of cost, CO

	abstract = {In recent years, the fourth industrial revolution has attracted attention worldwide. Several concepts were born in conjunction with this new revolution, such as predictive maintenance. This study aims to investigate academic advances in failure prediction. The prediction of failures takes into account concepts as a predictive maintenance decision support system and a design support system. We focus on frameworks that use machine learning and reasoning for predictive maintenance in Industry 4.0. More speciﬁcally, we consider the challenges in the application of machine learning techniques and ontologies in the context of predictive maintenance. We conduct a systematic review of the literature (SLR) to analyze academic articles that were published online from 2015 until the beginning of June 2020. The screening process resulted in a ﬁnal population of 38 studies of a total of 562 analyzed. We removed papers not directly related to predictive maintenance, machine learning, as well as researches classiﬁed as surveys or reviews. We discuss the proposals and results of these papers, considering three research questions. This article contributes to the ﬁeld of predictive maintenance to highlight the challenges faced in the area, both for implementation and use-case. We conclude by pointing out that predictive maintenance is a hot topic in the context of Industry 4.0 but with several challenges to be better investigated in the area of machine learning and the application of reasoning.},

	abstract = {With the tremendous revival of artificial intelligence, predictive maintenance (PdM) based on data-driven methods has become the most effective solution to address smart manufacturing and industrial big data, especially for performing health perception (e.g., fault diagnosis and remaining life assessment). Moreover, because the existing PdM research is still in primary experimental stage, most works are conducted utilizing several open-datasets, and the combination with specific applications such as rotating machinery is especially rare. Hence, in this paper, we focus on data-driven methods for PdM, present a comprehensive survey on its applications, and attempt to provide graduate students, companies, and institutions with the preliminary understanding of the existing works recently published. Specifically, we first briefly introduce the PdM approach, illustrate our PdM scheme for automatic washing equipment, and demonstrate the challenges encountered when we conduct a PdM research. Second, we classify the specific industrial applications based on six algorithms of machine learning and deep learning (DL), and compare five performance metrics for each classification. Furthermore, the accuracy (a metric to evaluate the algorithm performance) of these PdM applications is analyzed in detail. There are some important conclusions: 1) the data used in the summarized literature are mostly from public datasets, such as case western reserve university (CWRU)/intelligent maintenance systems (IMS); and 2) in recent years, researchers seem to focus more on DL algorithms for PdM research. Finally, we summarize the common features regarding our surveyed PdM applications and discuss several potential directions.},
