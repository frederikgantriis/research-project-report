In this paper, a simple dispersion algorithm based on wireless signal intensities is proposed and tested in a physics based simulator of a robotic platform which is particularly designed to serve as a test-bed for swarm-robotic studies. The signal intensities are realistically modeled using sampling technique, taking both the distance and relative orientations of the wireless sensors into account.

	abstract = {Abstract
            Social insects owe their widespread success to their ability to efficiently coordinate behaviour to carry out complex tasks. Several leaf-cutter ant species employ an advanced type of division of labour known as task partitioning, where the task of retrieving leaves is distributed between workers that cut and drop and those that collect the fallen leaves. It is not entirely clear how such highly coordinated behaviour can evolve, as it would seem to require the simultaneous mutations of multiple traits during the same generation. Here, we use an agent-based simulation model to show how task partitioning in leaf-cutter ants can gradually evolve by exploiting stigmergy (indirect coordination through the environment) through gravity (leaves falling from the treetop on the ground forming a cache). Our simple model allows independent variation in two core behavioural dimensions: the tendency to drop leaves and the tendency to pick up dropped leaves. Task partitioning readily evolves even under these minimal assumptions through adaptation to an arboreal environment where traveling up and down the tree is costly. Additionally, we analyse ant movement dynamics to demonstrate how the ants achieve efficient task allocation through task switching and negative feedback control.},

          , 
            Automation has become an increasingly popular tool for synthetic chemists over the past decade. Recent advances in robotics and computer science have led to the emergence of automated systems that execute common laboratory procedures including parallel synthesis, reaction discovery, reaction optimization, time course studies, and crystallization development. While such systems offer many potential benefits, their implementation is rarely automatic due to the highly specialized nature of synthetic procedures. Each reaction category requires careful execution of a particular sequence of steps, the specifics of which change with different conditions and chemical systems. Careful assessment of these critical procedural requirements and identification of the tools suitable for effective experimental execution are key to developing effective automation workflows. Even then, it is often difficult to get all the components of an automated system integrated and operational. Data flows and specialized equipment present yet another level of challenge. Unfortunately, the pain points and process of implementing automated systems are often not shared or remain buried deep in the SI. This perspective provides an overview of the current state of automation of synthetic chemistry at the benchtop scale with a particular emphasis on core considerations and the ensuing challenges of deploying a system. Importantly, we aim to reframe automation as decidedly not automatic but rather an iterative process that involves a series of careful decisions (both human and computational) and constant adjustment.},

              This review proposes the concept of a “frugal twin,” similar to a digital twin, but for physical experiments. Frugal twins range from simple toy examples to low-cost surrogates of high-cost research systems. For example, a color-mixing self-driving laboratory (SDL) can serve as a low-cost version of a costly multi-step chemical discovery SDL. Frugal twins already provide hands-on experience for SDLs with low costs and low risks. They can also offer as test beds for software prototyping (
              e.g.
              , optimization, data infrastructure), and a low barrier to entry for democratizing SDLs. However, there is room for improvement. The true value of frugal twins can be realized in three core areas. Firstly, hardware and software modularity; secondly, purpose-built design (human-inspired
              vs.
              hardware-centric
              vs.
              human-in-the-loop); and thirdly state-of-the-art (SOTA) software (
              e.g.
              , multi-fidelity optimization). We also describe the ethical benefits and risks that come with the democratization of science through frugal twins. For future work, we suggest ideas for new frugal twins, SDL educational course outcomes, and a classification scheme for autonomy levels.},

              Advances in robotic automation, high-performance computing (HPC), and artificial intelligence (AI) encourage us to conceive of
              science factories
              : large, general-purpose computation- and AI-enabled self-driving laboratories (SDLs) with the generality and scale needed both to tackle large discovery problems and to support thousands of scientists. Science factories require modular hardware and software that can be replicated for scale and (re)configured to support many applications. To this end, we propose a prototype modular science factory architecture in which reconfigurable
              modules
              encapsulating scientific instruments are linked with manipulators to form
              workcells

              applications

We report on our experiences prototyping this architecture and applying it in experiments involving 15 different robotic apparatus, five applications (one in education, two in biology, two in materials), and a variety of workflows, across four laboratories. We describe the reuse of modules, workcells, and workflows in different applications, the migration of applications between workcells, and the use of digital twins, and suggest directions for future work aimed at yet more generality and scalability.

Humans are very good at this coordination, and typically achieve ﬂuent turn-taking with very small gaps and little overlap. Conversational systems (including voice assistants and social robots), on the other hand, typically have problems with frequent interruptions and long response delays, which has called for a substantial body of research on how to improve turn-taking in conversational systems. In this review article, we provide an overview of this research and give directions for future research. First, we provide a theoretical background of the linguistic research tradition on turn-taking and some of the fundamental concepts in theories of turn-taking. We also provide an extensive review of multi-modal cues (including verbal cues, prosody, breathing, gaze and gestures) that have been found to facilitate the coordination of turn-taking in human-human interaction, and which can be utilised for turn-taking in conversational systems. After this, we review work that has been done on modelling turn-taking, including end-of-turn detection, handling of user interruptions, generation of turn-taking cues, and multi-party human-robot interaction. Finally, we identify key areas where more research is needed to achieve ﬂuent turn-taking in spoken interaction between man and machine.},

	abstract = {Regression analysis makes up a large part of supervised machine learning, and consists of the prediction of a continuous independent target from a set of other predictor variables. The difference between binary classification and regression is in the target range: in binary classification, the target can have only two values (usually encoded as 0 and 1), while in regression the target can have multiple values. Even if regression analysis has been employed in a huge number of machine learning studies, no consensus has been reached on a single, unified, standard metric to assess the results of the regression itself. Many studies employ the mean square error (MSE) and its rooted variant (RMSE), or the mean absolute error (MAE) and its percentage variant (MAPE). Although useful, these rates share a common drawback: since their values can range between zero and +infinity, a single value of them does not say much about the performance of the regression with respect to the distribution of the ground truth elements. In this study, we focus on two rates that actually generate a high score only if the majority of the elements of a ground truth group has been correctly predicted: the coefficient of determination (also known as R-squared or R2) and the symmetric mean absolute percentage error (SMAPE). After showing their mathematical properties, we report a comparison between R2 and SMAPE in several use cases and in two real medical scenarios. Our results demonstrate that the coefficient of determination (R-squared) is more informative and truthful than SMAPE, and does not have the interpretability limitations of MSE, RMSE, MAE and MAPE. We therefore suggest the usage of R-squared as standard metric to evaluate regression analyses in any scientific domain.},

Conversely, Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, and Best Polynomial Ridge Regression demonstrate significantly lower MSE values and nearly identical R² scores, each explaining approximately 60\% of the variance in housing prices. Among these, Best Polynomial Ridge Regression marginally outperforms Linear and Ridge Regression, suggesting that including polynomial features enhances model performance. Although Lasso Regression shows slightly higher MSE than the leading models, it still performs better than Elastic Net and SVR.

	abstract = {Abstract Cement manufacturing is energy-intensive (5Gj/t) and comprises a significant portion of the energy footprint of concrete systems. Incorporating modern monitoring, simulation and control systems will allow lower energy use, lower environmental impact, and lower costs of this widely used construction material. One of the goals of the CESMII roadmap project on the Smart Manufacturing of Cement included developing an analytical process model for clinker quality that includes the chemistry of the kiln feed and accounts for critical process variables. This predictive model will be used in nonlinear model predictive control system designed to significantly reduce process energy use while maintaining or improving product quality. In the cement manufacturing plant used in this study, the kiln feed (meal) is tested every 12 h and used to estimate the mineral composition of the cement kiln output (clinker) using the stoichiometry-based Bogue's model and the expertise of the plant operators. During kiln operation, kiln output (clinker) is sampled and tested every 2 h to measure its chemical and mineral composition. The predicted and measured values of the clinker composition are used by the plant operators to adjust the kiln input stream and the production process characteristics to maintain stable operation and uniform product quality. However, the time delay between prediction and testing, along with inaccuracies inherent in the Bogue's model have made any process changes designed to minimize energy use problematic, especially in-light of potential clinker quality issues that process changes often pose. A new analytical model that integrates quality information and process operation information has been developed from data collected from 2 years of production from an operating cement facility. To make the model fuel-type-independent, consumed heat energy was computed in the model instead of fuel type and amount. A Feedforward Network was trained and tailored from collected data. Many data-based simulations were conducted to quantitatively evaluate the proposed model and the 5-fold cross-validation procedure was used to test the models. The resulting predictive model was shown to have a low root mean square error (MSE) with respect to the estimated clinker mineral composition compared to that using the industry standard “Bogue’ model”. The end goal of this work was to develop a single machine learning tool that allows the use of quality control data and process control variables to improve energy efficiency of the process in a continuous fashion. The proposed nonlinear model predictive control system (NMPC) can generate predicted kiln production characteristics based on manipulated variables in manner that accurately follows the target product quality values. Simulation results also show that the proposed model produced accurate predictions of kiln outputs that fell within the required constraints, while manipulating control variables within typical operational ranges.},

Vibration measurements are used to monitor the condition of the machine for predictive maintenance and to predict the gearbox faults successfully. This paper addresses the use of vibration signal for automated fault diagnosis of gearbox. In the experimental studies, good gears and face wear gears are used to collect vibration signals for good and faulty conditions of the gearbox. Each gear is tested with two different speeds and loading conditions. The statistical features are extracted from the acquired vibration signals. The extracted features are given as an input to the support vector machine (SVM) for fault identification. The Performance of the fault identification system using vibration signals are discussed and compared.},

In this perspective, we reveal how ML implementations have improved this process in many aspects, for both absorption- and adsorption-based approaches, ranging from the molecular to process level. We discuss the role of ML in predicting the thermodynamic properties of absorbents and in improving the absorption process. For adsorption processes, we discuss the promises of ML techniques for exploring many options to find the most cost-effective process scheme, which involves choosing a solid adsorbent and designing a process configuration. We also highlight the advantages of ML and the associated risks, elaborate on the importance of the features needed to train ML models, and identify promising future opportunities for ML in carbon capture processes.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {The application of artificial neural networks in mapping the mechanical characteristics of the cement-based materials is underlined in previous investigations. However, this machine learning technique includes several major deficiencies highlighted in the literature, such as the overfitting problem and the inability to explain the decisions. Hence, the present study investigates the applicability of other common machine learning techniques, i.e., support vector machine, random forest (RF), decision tree, AdaBoost and k-nearest neighbors in mapping the behavior of the compressive strength (CS) of cement-based mortars. To this end, a big experimental database has been compiled based on experimental data available in the literature considering, namely the cement grade, which is an important parameter for the modeling of mortar’s CS. Other important parameters are namely the age, the water-to-binder ratio, the particle size distribution of the sand and the amount of plasticizer. Many models based on the influential factors affecting machine learning techniques have been developed, and their prediction capacities have been assessed using performance indexes. The present research highlights the potential of AdaBoost and RF models as useful tools which can assist in mortar design and/or optimization. In addition, mapping the development of mortar characteristics can assist in revealing the influence of the different mortar mix parameters on the compressive strength.},

This examination delves into how AI powered automation processes can boost the effectiveness of carbon capture systems and improve maintenance practices, in oil and gas installations. Combining intelligence (AI) with procedures and systems in place to predict outcomes accurately can enhance the dependability and effectiveness of CCS technologies by tackling essential issues like constant monitoring in real-time and identifying faults for system optimization purposes efficiently. AI-powered automation processes implemented by facilities have the potential to boost the rates of CO2 sequestration while minimizing interruptions, resulting in a more effective carbon capture infrastructure. The methodology involves a systematic review of existing literature, peer-reviewed articles, case studies, and industry reports on AI techniques, such as machine learning and neural networks, in CCS. Databases like Google Scholar and IEEE Xplore were used, focusing on keywords like “AI in CCS” and “predictive maintenance. The analysis also explores real-life examples from oil and gas firms that have effectively integrated AI solutions into their carbon capture and storage endeavors, hence shedding light on strategies, hurdles, and upcoming developments in the field.

PdM is a prominent strategy for dealing with maintenance issues given the increasing need to minimize downtime and associated costs. One of the challenges with PdM is generating so called ’health factors’ or quantitative indicators of the status of a system associated with a given maintenance issue, and determining their relationship to operating costs and failure risk. The proposed PdM methodology allows dynamical decision rules to be adopted for maintenance management and can be used with high-dimensional and censored data problems. This is achieved by training multiple classiﬁcation modules with different prediction horizons to provide different performance trade-offs in terms of frequency of unexpected breaks and unexploited lifetime and then employing this information in an operating cost based maintenance decision system to minimise expected costs. The effectiveness of the methodology is demonstrated using a simulated example and a benchmark semiconductor manufacturing maintenance problem.},

              Setting and strength development of ordinary Portland cement (OPC) binders involves multiple interacting chemical reactions, resulting in the formation of a solid microstructure. A long‐standing yet elusive goal has been to establish a basis for the prediction of the properties and performance of concrete using knowledge of the chemical and physical attributes of its components—PC, sand, stone, water, and chemical admixtures—together with the environmental conditions under which they react. Machine learning (ML) provides a
              data‐driven
              basis for the estimation of properties, and has recently been applied to estimate the 28 days (compressive) strength of concrete from knowledge of its mixture proportions (Young et al,

              115
              :379). Building on this success, the current work uses a diverse dataset of ASTM C150 cements, the chemical composition and other attributes of which have been measured. ML estimators were trained with this dataset to estimate both paste setting time and mortar strength development. The ML estimation errors are typically similar to the measurement repeatability of the relevant ASTM test methods, and are thus able to account for the influence of binder composition and fineness. This creates new opportunities to apply data intensive methods to optimize concrete formulations under multiple constraints of cost, CO

	abstract = {In recent years, the fourth industrial revolution has attracted attention worldwide. Several concepts were born in conjunction with this new revolution, such as predictive maintenance. This study aims to investigate academic advances in failure prediction. The prediction of failures takes into account concepts as a predictive maintenance decision support system and a design support system. We focus on frameworks that use machine learning and reasoning for predictive maintenance in Industry 4.0. More speciﬁcally, we consider the challenges in the application of machine learning techniques and ontologies in the context of predictive maintenance. We conduct a systematic review of the literature (SLR) to analyze academic articles that were published online from 2015 until the beginning of June 2020. The screening process resulted in a ﬁnal population of 38 studies of a total of 562 analyzed. We removed papers not directly related to predictive maintenance, machine learning, as well as researches classiﬁed as surveys or reviews. We discuss the proposals and results of these papers, considering three research questions. This article contributes to the ﬁeld of predictive maintenance to highlight the challenges faced in the area, both for implementation and use-case. We conclude by pointing out that predictive maintenance is a hot topic in the context of Industry 4.0 but with several challenges to be better investigated in the area of machine learning and the application of reasoning.},

Moreover, because the existing PdM research is still in primary experimental stage, most works are conducted utilizing several open-datasets, and the combination with specific applications such as rotating machinery is especially rare. Hence, in this paper, we focus on data-driven methods for PdM, present a comprehensive survey on its applications, and attempt to provide graduate students, companies, and institutions with the preliminary understanding of the existing works recently published. Specifically, we first briefly introduce the PdM approach, illustrate our PdM scheme for automatic washing equipment, and demonstrate the challenges encountered when we conduct a PdM research. Second, we classify the specific industrial applications based on six algorithms of machine learning and deep learning (DL), and compare five performance metrics for each classification. Furthermore, the accuracy (a metric to evaluate the algorithm performance) of these PdM applications is analyzed in detail. There are some important conclusions: 1) the data used in the summarized literature are mostly from public datasets, such as case western reserve university (CWRU)/intelligent maintenance systems (IMS); and 2) in recent years, researchers seem to focus more on DL algorithms for PdM research. Finally, we summarize the common features regarding our surveyed PdM applications and discuss several potential directions.},
